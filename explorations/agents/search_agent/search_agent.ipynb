Stragglers can arise for a whole host of reasons. For example, a machine with a bad disk may experience frequent cor- rectable errors that slow its read performance from 30MB/s to 1MB/s. The cluster scheduling system may have scheduled other tasks on the machine, causing it to execute the MapReduce code more slowly due to competition for CPU, memory, local disk, or network bandwidth. A recent problem we experienced was a bug in machine initialization code that caused processor caches to be disabled: computations on affected machines slowed down by over a factor of one hundred.', 'pdf_path': '/Users/faizahmed/Documents/SJSU/topics_in_db/Project/data-ingestion/data/mapreduce.pdf', 'page_number': '4', 'idx': '24.txt', 'score': 0.57518333}, {'text': '5. When a reduce worker is notified by the master about these loca- tions, it uses remote procedure calls to read the buffered data from the local disks of the map workers. When a reduce worker has read all intermediate data for its partition, it sorts it by the intermediate keys so that all occurrences of the same key are grouped together. The sorting is needed because typically many different keys map to the same reduce task. If the amount of intermediate data is too large to fit in memory, an external sort is used.\\n\\n6. The reduce worker iterates over the sorted intermediate data and for each unique intermediate key encountered, it passes the key and the corresponding set of intermediate values to the userâ€™s reduce func- tion. The output of the reduce function is appended to a final out- put file for this reduce partition.\\n\\nMapReduce: Simplified Data Processing on Large Clusters\\n\\nUser Program\\n\\n(1) fork\\n\\n(1) fork\\n\\n(1) fork\\n\\nMaster\\n\\n(2) assign map\\n\\n(2) assign reduce\\n\\nworker\\n\\nsplit 0\\n\\nsplit 1\\n\\nsplit 2', 'pdf_path': '/Users/faizahmed/Documents/SJSU/topics_in_db/Project/data-ingestion/data/mapreduce.pdf', 'page_number': '2', 'idx': '12.txt', 'score': 0.5545014}, {'text': 'We have a general mechanism to alleviate the problem of stragglers.

The task is marked as completed whenever either the primary or the backup execution completes.

We have found that this significantly reduces the time to complete large MapReduce operations. As an example, the sort program described in Section 5.3 takes 44% longer to complete when the backup task mechanism is disabled.\\n\\n4 Refinements Although the basic functionality provided by simply writing map and reduce functions is sufficient for most needs, we have found a few extensions useful.

Each in-progress task writes its output to private temporary files. A reduce task produces one such file, and a map task produces R such files (one per reduce task). When a map task com- pletes, the worker sends a message to the master and includes the names of the R temporary files in the message.

For example, during one MapReduce operation, network maintenance on a running cluster was causing groups of 80 machines at a time to become unreach- able for several minutes. The MapReduce master simply re executed the work done by the unreachable worker machines and continued to make forward progress, eventually completing the MapReduce operation.\\n\\n3.3 Fault Tolerance Since the MapReduce library is designed to help process very large amounts of data using hundreds or thousands of machines, the library must tolerate machine failures gracefully.', 'pdf_path': '/Users/faizahmed/Documents/SJSU/topics_in_db/Project/data-ingestion/data/mapreduce.pdf', 'page_number': '3', 'idx': '16.txt', 'score': 0.4914191}, {'text': 'Fig. 2.

The rate grad- ually picks up as more machines are assigned to this MapReduce com- putation and peaks at over 30 GB/s when 1764 workers have been assigned. As the map tasks finish, the rate starts dropping and hits zero about 80 seconds into the computation. The entire computation takes approximately 150 seconds from start to finish. This includes about a minute of startup overhead. The overhead is due to the propagation of the program to all worker machines and delays interacting with GFS to open the set of 1000 input files and to get the information needed for the locality optimization.\\n\\n5.3 Sort The sort program sorts 1010 100-byte records (approximately 1 terabyte of data).

The number of partitions (R) and the partitioning function are specified by the user. Figure 1 shows the overall flow of a MapReduce operation in our implementation.
